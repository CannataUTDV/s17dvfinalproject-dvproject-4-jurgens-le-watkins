-+ The tableau plot shows the percentage of people with no internet connection per each state. The red states have a higher percentage of people with no connection than green states. **Most of the more expansive states such as Alaska, Texas, and Montanna, understabily have a higher percenatage of no internet connection.** Another notable takeaway, that could possibly pair with the first key finding is the seemingly **higher percentage of no internet connection in the southeast**.
